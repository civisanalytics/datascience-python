## Unreleased

## [3.0.0] - 2017-05-17

## [2.2.0] - 2017-05-02
### Removed
- Remove pinned conda installs of `libgcc` and `libsodium`. This prevented use of the environment file in OS X, and they are dependencies automatically installed by conda in the Docker image build.

### Additions
- Explicitly added `botocore` v1.5.38. We had `botocore` installed before (it's a dependency of other AWS libraries), but we're now explicitly including the version number.
